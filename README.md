# ToDo-API-Minimal

This is a simple API for a small to-do list application. 

It is build using the ASP.NET Core 8 framework and uses Entity Framework Core for database interaction/persistence.

It manipulates a single model, Item, using the HTTP verbs, GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE.

It uses MinimalAPI controllers, so most of the action happens in Program.cs.

I am developing a functionally identical API using traditional controllers at the same time.
